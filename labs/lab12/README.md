## Password clearing/recovery
**1. Description**

[Password recovery/cracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_cracking) is the process of recovering passwords from data that has been stored in or transmitted by a computer system. A common approach (brute-force attack) is to repeatedly try guesses for the password and to check them against an available cryptographic hash of the password.

Password recovery can be exploited to 
* help users recover forgotten passwords, 
* gain unauthorized access to a system in penetration test,
* gain legal access to digital evidence, etc.

However, in many cases especially the cost for cracking a password is too high, password clear could be the only feasible method.
